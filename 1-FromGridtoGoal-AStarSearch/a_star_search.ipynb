    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In video games, search techniques are commonly applied to path-finding. Even though game characters usually move within continuous spaces, it's straightforward to design a navigation system using a grid of \"waypoints\" overlaid on that space. To travel from Point A to Point B, a character first performs a line of sight (LOS) scan to identify the closest waypoint to its starting point (named Waypoint A) and the closest LOS waypoint to its destination (named Waypoint B). The A* search algorithm is then employed to determine the shortest path from Waypoint A to Waypoint B. Consequently, the complete journey comprises four segments: from Point A to Waypoint A, then to Waypoint B, and finally to Point B.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this concept more digestible, we'll represent the problem within a grid world. In this representation, different symbols on the grid will denote various types of terrain, each having its own cost for entry:\n",

    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "place initial state on frontier\n",

    "\tadd current-state to explored\n",
    "return nil\n",
    "```\n",
    "This pseudocode outlines the basic framework for a State Space Search. Initially, it places the starting state on what's known as the \"frontier\" and initializes a list of explored states. As long as there are states on the frontier, the algorithm continues to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each iteration, the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selects the next state from the frontier (referred to as \"current-state\").\n",
    "- Checks if this state is the goal (or a \"terminal\" state), and if so, returns the path to it.\n",
    "- Identifies the children or successor states of the current state.\n",
    "- Adds each child state to the frontier if it hasn’t been explored or already on the frontier.\n",
    "- Finally, adds the current state to the explored list to prevent re-exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the frontier is emptied without finding a goal state, the algorithm returns nil, indicating no path found.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of State Space Search, this pseudocode succinctly captures the essence of exploring a space systematically. It helps us not only to navigate through different states efficiently but also to ensure that we consider all possible paths to find the most optimal route to our goal."

    "\n",
    "I hope you found this journey through the code as engaging and insightful as I did in creating it. Your curiosity is what drives innovation, and I encourage you to take it a step further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to play around with this code! Why not try changing the shape of the world or selecting new starting and goal points? Instead of the default starting point in the top left corner or the goal in the bottom right corner, you can experiment with different coordinates to see how the algorithm adapts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your creativity and experimentation not only enhance your understanding but also open new doors for exploration and innovation. Who knows? You might stumble upon a novel approach or insight that could contribute to the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any thoughts, questions, or discoveries, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding, and keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible! "
